Unity Ahead of Time compilation and System.Reflection restrictions

Wave engine severe lack of documentation and guides

Android filesystem - app files in .apk format read-only mapped to /apk, unreadable by System.IO

Manual runtime generation of map model
- visual studio android emulator OpenGl bug making manually generated map model invisible 

tile textures and mapping of tiles to tile textures

pathfinding algorithms - A*

prioriy queue - C5 library, BlueRaja priority queue

Unit tests for android, NUnit and Visual studio integration

Camera control, rotations, transform spaces, camera bounding

Game state saving - important for mobile because of the posibility of termination on lost focus
- internal XML scene serialization of Urho3D
- external binary protocol buffers format, for posible external map editor tool integration, speed and save file size
- protobuf-net asReference problems with collections

- store used packages, used tileTypes, unitTypes and building types with their level local ID and global name
  - reference by level local ID

- multiphase loading because of the ID references

Shadows, ambient light, normal vectors for map

Which diagonal should be the one between the triangles forming one tile
- let user choose (create tool) - needs to be saved in save file, hard height interpolation inside a tile
- decided that the one that is higher - easy height interpolation, consistent across the whole map, less data stored

Border tiles - where to store height
- topLeft corner, interpolate rest from the neighbouring tiles and their top left corner
  - needs to somehow include extra tiles at the right and bottom to fill the heights of all the tile corners
  - border tiles, tiles at the border that store all 4 of their corner heights
    - to hide the map ending, to store the height of rightmost and bottommost playfield tiles 
- center of the tile - cannot be displayed in the game, can only set heights of the corners

Tools - to separate different types input handling
- UI and Input connection

UI - UrhoSharp/Urho3D vs platform specific
  - problem with urhoSharp being just an external viewport
  - Xamarin.Forms, Xamarin.Android

Input - mouse and keyboard, touch
  - sensitivity, continuous movement vs. noncontinuous movement
  - key rebinding

Vertex buffer and index buffer locking speeds
- lock whole needed part or is locking rows enough

Ambient light and fog
- smoother, less visible shadows
- fog looks wierd

Barycentric coordinates for height at general point inside a tile (Christer Ericson's Real-Time Collision Detection)

Isolate dependence on StUnit only to Unit class
- that is why Unit is created and loaded by static methods that add the created instance immediately to the provided scene node,
  so i can set the position of the unit (by setting the position of the node)
- this would not be possible within constructor, because i could add the unit to node only after the constructor


Protocol buffers visual studio integration, tools and multiple .proto files in one package
- they keep failing, because they are calling protoc with every file separately
- the extension even copies the .proto file to tempfile and runs it there, completely missing imports


Full physics engine vs. lightweight manual simulation

Getting all units in range, calculating how to shoot at the target

Saving data for user provided plugins, wrappers around protocol buffers for easier access and some type safety
- sequential, indexed and named polymorfic data streams

DDS format, they forgot to provide decompress method on the CompressedFormat to get a normal image

abstract class with all notification methods virtual transformed into an abstract class,
with a generic check for interface implementation when constructing the default component
- this way the user will only have the methods he really uses, no empty default implementations

missing mapping for both PhysicsWorld.GetRigidBodies() and Octree.GetDrawables()

added animations

streamlined XML representation, XSD schema and things

added support for material list
- material list API is weird, if it does not find the material list file, it just does not assign textures, need to check the existence of the file

Missing Thread class from Urho3D

TODO:

Mipmapping of tile textures
