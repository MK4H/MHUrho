Barycentric coordinates for height at general point inside a tile (Christer Ericson's Real-Time Collision Detection)

Isolate dependence on StUnit only to Unit class
- that is why Unit is created and loaded by static methods that add the created instance immediately to the provided scene node,
  so i can set the position of the unit (by setting the position of the node)
- this would not be possible within constructor, because i could add the unit to node only after the constructor
